Slicing: a sustainable approach to structuring samples for analysis in long-term studies, 
Methods in Ecology and Evolution

The R simulations provided in this folder were used to determine the statistical power and precision for aggregation of samples
in a single batch, randomisation of samples, and slicing samples.

The parameters in the simulations can be changed for specific datasets when desirable.
